# uIP configuration file
#
# At a minimum you need "iface", "hwaddr", "ipv4_addr" and a route.
# The example below sets uIP to work on a 192.168.0.0/24 network,
# where the default router address is 192.168.0.1.

# Interface configuration
iface = "tap0";
hwaddr = "16:c6:42:ab:4a:49";
ipv4_addr = "192.168.0.33";

### Routes
###

# This route ensures that uIP delivery packets to the
# 192.168.0.0/24 network
route1:
{
	destination = "192.168.0.0";
	mask = "255.255.255.0";
	router = "0.0.0.0";
};

# This is the default route. If the router has Internet connectivity,
# you'll be able to reach the Internet.
route2:
{
	destination = "0.0.0.0";
	mask = "0.0.0.0";
	router = "192.168.0.1";
};
